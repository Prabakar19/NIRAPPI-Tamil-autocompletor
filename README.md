# NIRAPPI-Tamil-autocompletor
type something in tamil and get suggestions


நிரப்பி-NIRAPPI
----------
Our idea is to develop auto complete in Tamil while type. When try to type anything, it gives suggestion which helps to complete your sentence.

-We had worked in two  same projects with different technologies.
-The first one is developed using JAVA SCRIPT, which is more like prototype.
-The second one is developed using JAVA and SPRING BOOT framework which helps to generate word with help of GENERATOR tool. We couldn’t completely finish this application as we expected, which has some issues. 

---------------------------------------------------------
This NIRAPPI.zip file cotains two folders.

1.The one named as NIRAPPI-1 is model of our project.

	-Used Technologies: 
		-JAVA SCRIPT.
		-Run "index.html" file.(open "index.html" file in any broswer).
		-Try to type anything in Tamil in the textbox given.
		(ex:வருகிறது,மக்களின்).

2.The one named as NIRAPPI-2 is exemplary model which is not completed yet.

	-Used Technologies: 
	-	JAVA, SPRING BOOT framework for webservice, JAVA SCRIPT(html,ajax) for front-end.	
	
	-Requirements:
		-Any one of JAVA IDE(preferable ECLIPSE).
		-Install SPRING BOOT plugin(preferable SPRING TOOL SUIT plugin ECLIPSE).
		-Open project “word generator” folder in IDE and run “WordGeneratorWebserviceApplication.java” which is located at “word_generator/src/main/java/com/example/demo/WordGeneratorWebserviceApplication.java” path.
		-Now open front-end forlder and run index.html file(open index.html in any browser).
		-Type any word in Tamil, it will give you suggestions below.
		(ex:எழு,படி,மொழி).

Future Enhancement:

	-Fix all the issues we have left out.
	-Develop our application from word level to sentence level. Auto complete for full sentence.
